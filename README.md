# LRMF-Ceres
This code uses Ceres-solver (http://ceres-solver.org/) to solve low-rank matrix factorization with missing data. It handles both with and without the inner iterations feature. You need to supply a measurement matrix (M), a weight matrix (W) and an initial set of two low-rank matrices (U and V).
